    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mogodu is a traditional South African dish made from beef tripe (the lining of a cow’s stomach). It’s usually slow-cooked until tender and enjoyed with pap (maize meal porridge). It’s hearty, rich in flavor, and often considered comfort food.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 kg beef tripe (cleaned and cut into pieces)</li>
        <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes (chopped or blended)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1–2 tbsp cooking oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp curry powder or paprika (optional, for flavor)</li>
        <li> Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>Water or beef stock (enough for boiling)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
  <li>Wash the tripe thoroughly. Place it in a pot, cover with water, and boil until soft (about 2–3 hours). Top up water as needed.</li>
  <li>In a separate pan, heat oil and sauté onion and garlic until golden. Add tomatoes and spices, cook into a sauce.</li>
  <li>Add boiled tripe to the sauce, season with salt and pepper, and simmer for another 15–20 minutes so flavors blend.</li>
  <li>Serve hot with pap, rice, or dumplings.</li>
</ol>
